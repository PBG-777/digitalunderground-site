        <h2>What is Digital Underground AI?</h2>
        <p class="section-text">
          Digital Underground AI is an experimental trend-intelligence engine
          built in Germany. It tracks AI conversations across social platforms
          and turns raw comments into signals for creators and investors.
        </p>
        <p class="section-text">
          This early prototype connects a Python-based NLP pipeline (NER + Sentiment)
          to a real-time dashboard through JSON exports.
          <em>Please note:</em> The current version of this website is a static demo.
          The underlying NLP pipeline and backend systems are actively being expanded,
          and new features will be added continuously in the coming days, weeks and months.

      <!-- ⭐ VISION SECTION ⭐ -->
      <section id="vision" class="section">
        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
      
        <p class="section-text">
          Humanity is moving into a world shaped by powerful LLMs and AI giants —
          systems trained on our personal data, optimized by corporations, and accessible mostly to those who can afford them.
          Wealthier individuals gain the privilege of intelligent tools that amplify their productivity, decision-making, and
          opportunities.
          Meanwhile, creators, tech workers, and investors struggle to understand which tools are rising, which are failing,
          and which technologies truly matter.
        </p>
      
        <p class="section-text">
          Digital Underground AI does not compete with large foundation models — we contextualize them.
          We transform the billions of signals created every day into actionable intelligence.
          Not for model training. For clarity. For strategic advantage.
        </p>
      
        <p class="section-text">
          We focus on three groups who rely on transparent insights the most:
        </p>
      
        <ul class="section-text">
          <li><strong>Creators</strong>, who must understand what topics resonate and where attention is shifting</li>
          <li><strong>Investors</strong>, who seek early signals about technologies and companies gaining real momentum</li>
          <li><strong>Everyday tech users and professionals</strong>, who rely on AI tools but can no longer see through the
            hype and the overwhelming number of emerging products</li>
        </ul>
      
        <p class="section-text">
          These people don’t need charity — they need accurate, transparent intelligence to stay competitive.
          Digital Underground AI delivers exactly that: clear, human-understandable signals for those who build, invest, and
          navigate the AI-driven economy.
